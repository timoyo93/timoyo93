ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @timoyo93

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in fullstack development with high interest in new technologies

âš¡ I like using C# in particular with ASP.NET Core and Entitiy Framework for the backend and for the frontend I know Angular but in 2022 I literally felt in love with Svelte â™¥

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Svelte with Typescript and TailwindCSS which is a super convenient way to build UI's very fast
